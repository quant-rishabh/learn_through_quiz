File Management Guidelines (Short and Clear)
These are the rules and folder structure to manage JSON files and images for quizzes. Follow these to keep things simple, organized, and scalable.

1. Folder Structure
learning_section/ (contains JSON files for quiz content)
<category>/ (e.g., english/, science/)
<lesson>.json (e.g., vocab.json, geography.json)
images/ (contains images for quiz questions)
<category>/ (e.g., english/, science/)
<lesson>/ (corresponds to the lesson in learning_section)
<topic>/ (same topic names as in the JSON file)
<image files> (e.g., apple.png, map_of_africa.png)
2. Rules for JSON Files
Basic Structure of JSON Files
Lesson JSON File: Represents a lesson (e.g., vocab.json).
Topics: Each topic contains an array of questions and answers.
Image Rules in JSON
If you need an image in the question:
You must include both "image": "name_of_image" and "type": "image".
If you need an image after the answer:
You only need "image": "name_of_image".
If no image is needed:
Don't include "image" or "type" keys.
Example JSON:
json
Copy code
{
    "fruits": [
        {
            "What is this fruit?": {
                "answer": "apple",
                "type": "image",
                "image": "apple.png"
            }
        },
        {
            "What color is a banana?": "yellow",
            "image": "banana.png"
        }
    ]
}
3. Folder Structure Overview
Example 1: JSON File Structure in learning_section/
Copy code
learning_section/
├── english/
│   ├── vocab.json
├── social_science/
│   ├── geography.json
Example 2: Image Folder Structure in images/
Copy code
images/
├── english/
│   ├── vocab/
│   │   ├── fruits/
│   │   │   ├── apple.png
│   │   │   ├── banana.png
├── social_science/
│   ├── geography/
│   │   ├── physical_geography/
│   │   │   ├── map_of_africa.png
4. Steps to Add New Content
Add a new lesson:

Create a new JSON file under learning_section/<category>/.
Example: learning_section/social_science/geography.json
Add a new topic in the lesson JSON file:

Add the topic name in the JSON.
Example:
json
Copy code
{
    "physical_geography": [
        {
            "What is the largest desert?": "Sahara Desert",
            "image": "sahara.png"
        }
    ]
}
Add corresponding images:

Place the images in the images/<category>/<lesson>/<topic>/ directory.
Example: images/social_science/geography/physical_geography/sahara.png
5. Key Points to Remember
JSON Files go inside learning_section/ folder.
Images go inside images/ folder in <category>/<lesson>/<topic> structure.
Image Reference:
If you need an image in the question, use both "image": "name_of_image" and "type": "image".
If you need an image after the answer, only use "image": "name_of_image".
By following these simple rules and structure, you can easily manage and scale the quiz system while keeping everything organized.
