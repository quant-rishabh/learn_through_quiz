Quick Rules for JSON Structure
General Structure:

Each JSON file corresponds to a subject or category (e.g., math.json).
Inside each file, topics are represented as keys, with a list of question objects as their values.
Question Object Keys:

question (Mandatory): The text of the question.
answer (Mandatory or Optional based on type):
Expected answer(s) separated by ;.
Additional info after @.
image (Optional): Path to the image file (mandatory if type is "image").
type (Optional):
"text" (default) for standard questions.
"image" if the question is based on an image.
Folder Structure:

JSON Files: Store in the directory specified under learning_section_directory in config.json.
Images: Store in images/<data_file>/<topic>/ structure.
Behavior:

type: "text": Displays the question and prompts for an answer.
type: "image": Displays an image and then prompts for an answer.
Practice and Results:

Incorrect answers lead to practice sessions (based on practice_attempts in config.json).
Results are stored in the directory specified by results_directory.
Special Commands:

skip: Skips the current question.
